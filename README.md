# Genesis of Appscribed

While everyone is hung up on new age tech to be used for their application, being a founder i had to make a really tough choice. Tough because:

I was boostrapped and technology has a huge cost attached to it
I was in Lucknow where getting talents on new age tech is difficult
& Being in the software industry, I am aware of the fact that every UI/UX, tech stack has a life cycle of 3-5 years max.

Having considered all these factors, i chose [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php) as it answered almost everything for me.

## Wordpress is a life saviour

80% of the world's websites are on Wordpress and 20% of the websites are really huge. If i have to define huge: its able to handle and serve more than a million users per month. My search for a [CMS](https://wordpress.com/go/tutorials/what-is-a-cms/) ended with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) as [Appscribed.com](https://appscribed.com) was all about capturing and serving the right content for our users for them to take the right software buying decisions for themselves.
